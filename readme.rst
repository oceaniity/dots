oceaniity's dotfiles
====================

This is a collection of my dotfiles and the necessary script to get them 
symlinked and into your system.

I guess it goes without saying that you should look at these before you decide
use them.

In this collection are several important files:
- .bashrc
- firefox user.js
- sublime text user preference files and keybindings

More stuff will be added as I go along...
